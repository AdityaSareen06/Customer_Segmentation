# Mismatched Customers Analysis Report

## **Overview**
This report provides an analysis of customers whose cluster assignments differed between K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. Understanding these mismatches helps in refining clustering models and identifying unique customer segments that may not fit conventional patterns.

---

## **1. Age Distribution of Mismatched Customers**

- **Mean Age:** 50 years
- **Age Range:** 20 to 69 years
- **75% of mismatched customers are older than 38.5 years**
- **Key Insight:** Mismatched customers are predominantly **middle-aged and senior individuals**, suggesting that older customers may have more complex spending patterns or behaviors that lead to inconsistent clustering.

---

## **2. Annual Income Distribution of Mismatched Customers**

- **Mean Annual Income:** 85.49k
- **Income Range:** 77.2k to 94.5k
- **75% of mismatched customers earn more than 82k**
- **Key Insight:** Mismatched customers tend to belong to the **higher-income bracket**. The clustering models may struggle to separate them effectively due to similarities in their spending behavior despite income differences.

---

## **3. Spending Score Distribution of Mismatched Customers**

- **Mean Spending Score:** 36.28 out of 100
- **Spending Score Range:** 5 to 100
- **Key Insight:** Mismatched customers show **a broad range of spending behaviors**, with no dominant trend. This suggests that spending habits alone may not be a defining characteristic for these customers.

## **4. Spending Behavior Distribution of Mismatched Customers**

| Spending Behavior | Count | Percentage |
|------------------|------|------------|
| **Low**         | 22   | 56%        |
| **Medium**      | 12   | 31%        |
| **High**        | 5    | 13%        |

- **Key Insight:** The majority (56%) of mismatched customers are **low spenders**, with another 31% classified as medium spenders. This indicates that spending behavior differences might play a significant role in why these customers were classified differently across models.

---

## **Final Observations & Next Steps**

ðŸ“Œ **Key Takeaways:**
- The mismatched customers **skew older (middle-aged & senior)**.
- They **earn relatively high incomes (above 77k)**.
- **Most are low to medium spenders**.
- Spending behavior **varies significantly**, which may contribute to classification differences.

ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**
- Use these insights to refine segmentation strategies and enhance clustering accuracy.
- Design a **dashboard** to visualize and explore mismatched customer trends interactively.
- Finalize these findings in the project report before moving to further enhancements.

This report serves as a foundational step before building the web dashboard, ensuring that we understand the characteristics of mismatched customers and their implications for customer segmentation strategies.
